## Purpose
This is a simple web page that is a point and click to navigate in browser. The Quiz will run through the set of questions while tracking time to completion. Upon reaching the end of the question set or running out of time, the game over logic will run, showing the user's score for the current session, and allowing them to save the score to local memory.
